                I'm at peace with the small role I've played in this last contradiction because I know he would have
                loved
                being recognized - and there's simply no one more deserving. All credit goes to Andrew Bolton, the
                Costume
                Institute's brilliant curator who has titled the new exhibition "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," an
                allusion to the painter William Hogarth, who believed that an ever-turning, ever-changing line captures
                more
                energy and life than a straight one. I can't imagine a better metaphor for the revolutionary effect Karl
                had
                on fashion.

                A life lived as Karl's was - gloriously, restlessly, always in public, and full of fascinating twists,
                turns, and transformations-warrants a celebration, and that is what we've organized here. Vogue is
                looking
                back at Karl's history, at his work for Chanel, Chloe, Fendi, and his own label. Rafael Pavarotti took
                the
                stunning photographs of these designs, with Karl's friend, muse, and collaborator Amanda Harlech by this
                side as fashion editor. To accompany them Amanda has written a magical remembrance of Karl that returns
                him
                to me in vivid detail-an act of memory for which I couldn't be more grateful.
